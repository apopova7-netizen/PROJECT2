## Features

### Module 1: Recursive Algorithms

* Classic backtracking permutation generation
* In-place recursive swap algorithm
* Lexicographic recursive permutations
* Permutations with constraints (constraint satisfaction)
* Multiset permutations (with repeated elements)

### Module 2: Iterative Algorithms

* Narayana next_permutation algorithm
* Reverse (prev_permutation) generation
* Factorial number system (permutation by index)
* Inversion table based generation
* Incremental (“plus-one”) permutation generation

### Module 3: Optimized Algorithms

* Johnson–Trotter algorithm (minimal changes)
* Heap’s algorithm (minimal swaps)
* Minimal-change (Gray code–like) permutations
* Cycle leader algorithm
* Bitmask-based generation (for small n)

### Module 4: Infrastructure

* Unified API for all algorithms
* Iterator-based interface
* Automatic algorithm selection
* Built-in benchmarks
* Unit tests and correctness verification
* Optional step-by-step visualization
